    <h1>Project Us</h1>
    <h2>Business Plan</h2>
    <p>Us-a geology-based mobile app that allows you to leave msg/videos/other types of information footprints at exact time and space you were in. The msgs are shared on the web and only viewable using AR mobile app which provides an unique experience to information. (Like Pokemon Go)<br />

    This is not another social media app, but contains social elements, and could go towards that direction. (Msging, private chat are basic features)<br />

    The goal of this app is to connect people, or give a sense of connection that eases loneliness. This is achieved by enabling people to view and examine othersâ€™ traveling paths, feelings, emotions, line of thoughts exactly where and when they generated them. Let it be positive, negative, laughter, tears, or anything.<br />

    Algorithms will be applied to categorize and personalize msg feeds in order to improve user experience.<br />

    Possible features:<br />
    -Main: Leave footprints at exact time and location, presented in the form of a speech bubble that is viewable by AR technologies on smartphones<br />
    -Allow poster to either reveal identity to public, a certain defined group, or remain anonymous. Poster can choose to hide identity and ignore incoming replies<br />

    Commercial value:<br />
    -Real-world yelp. People are able to post comments that can only be viewed on-site. This creates a better background and perspective to understand the comment, thus making the message more powerful and authentic.<br />
    -For viewers: Fastest access to comments and information to unfamiliar locations or situations<br />
    -UGC community<br />
    -Diary/travel journal<br />
    -Real-time and location personal/corporate branding.<br />
    -AR technology enables us to model a new dataset of information based on time and geographical information, thus enabling further studies in human behavior or relevant research<br />
    -Group collaboration tool for institutes that needs geographic mapping.<br />

    Goals<br />

    -Make people less lonely. Most of us crave for attention, love, being heard, and being able to sympathize. This app will help make the world a better place to live.<br />

    Monetization<br />
